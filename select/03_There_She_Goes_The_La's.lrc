[00:33.25] There she goes
[00:36.85] There she goes again
[00:40.73] Racing through my brain
[00:44.88] And I just can't contain
[00:48.44] This feelin' that remains
[01:00.94] 
[00:54.69] There she blows
[00:58.42] There she blows again
[01:02.24] Pulsing through my vein
[01:06.38] And I just can't contain
[01:09.95] This feelin' that remains
[01:22.45] 
[01:37.63] There she goes
[01:41.23] There she goes again
[01:44.08] She calls my name, pulls my train
[01:47.95] No one else could heal my pain
[01:52.85] But I just can't contain
[01:56.67] This feelin' that remains
[02:09.17] 
[02:00.52] There she goes
[02:04.41] There she goes again
[02:08.51] Chasing down my lane
[02:12.64] And I just can't contain
[02:16.26] This feelin' that remains
[02:28.76] 
[02:22.62] There she goes
[02:25.22] (There she goes again)
[02:26.73] There she goes
[02:28.81] (There she goes again)
[02:30.57] There she goes
[02:32.92] (There she goes again)
