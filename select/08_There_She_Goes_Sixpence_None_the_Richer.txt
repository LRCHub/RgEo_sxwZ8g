There she goes
There she goes again
Racing through my brain
And I just can't contain
This feeling that remains

There she goes
There she goes again
Pulsing through my veins
And I just can't contain
This feeling that remains

There she goes
(There she goes again)
There she goes again
(There she goes again)
Racing through my brain
(There she goes)
And I just can't contain
This feeling that remains

There she goes
There she goes again
She calls my name
Holds my brain
And no one else could heal my pain
And I just can't contain
This feeling that remains

There she goes
(She calls my name)
There she goes again
(She calls my name)
Chasing down my lane
(She calls my name)
And I just can't contain
This feeling that remains

There she goes
(There she goes again)
There she goes
(There she goes again)
There she goes
