[00:15.40] There she goes again
[00:18.68] She's out on the streets again
[00:22.07] She's down on her knees, my friend
[00:25.92] But you know she'll never ask you please again
[00:48.92] 
[00:31.73] Now take a look, there's no tears in her eyes
[00:35.23] She won't take it from just any guy, what can you do
[00:41.01] You see her walkin' on down the street
[00:45.09] Look at all your friends she's gonna meet
[00:48.51] You better hit her
[00:57.51] 
[01:04.73] There she goes again
[01:08.17] She's knocked out on her feet again
[01:12.15] She's down on her knees, my friend
[01:15.73] But you know she'll never ask you please again
[01:38.73] 
[01:20.72] Now take a look, there's no tears in her eyes
[01:25.18] Like a bird, you know she would fly, what can you do
[01:30.69] You see her walkin' on down the street
[01:34.60] Look at all your friends that she's gonna meet
[01:39.23] You better hit her
[01:48.23] 
[02:11.66] Now take a look, there's no tears in her eyes
[02:15.16] Like a bird, you know she will fly, fly, fly away
[02:20.59] See her walking on down the street
[02:23.82] Look at all your friends that she's gonna meet
[02:46.82] 
[02:26.98] She's gonna bawl and shout
[02:28.98] She's gonna work it
[02:29.86] She's gonna work it out, bye bye
[02:31.13] Bye bye baby
